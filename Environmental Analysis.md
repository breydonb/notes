,# Area of Responsibility

Based on client/owner requirements, you have to rely on specific limits of responsibility and speak to facility managers to prevent potential threats from happening in a facility.

Relying on a scope of the facility, you can be responsible for faculty, customers, and property of area of interest

# Area of Interest
Geographic areas that can affect the overall security. Examples of this are response capabilities.
## Response Capabilities
If there is a fire on EIU's campus, the location of the fire dept. might be important to determine how they can get there. If it takes 10 minutes for the fire department to reach the location, you need to worry what to do in 10 minutes. The proximities of police and health care. How long it will take? What is the agreements of jurisdiction.

Training and Development ties directly into the overall response capabilities. Along with this, communication between two municipal entities is crucial towards effective response capabilities. 

### Area of Operations Analysis
People - students, faculty, administrative staff, response teams, and visitors
Property - School buildings, parking lots, sidewalks, and handicap parking and ramps
Things - Company Assets necessary for the operations of business

### Area of Interest Analysis
People - news media, parents, etc.
Property - Location of Charleston High School and Charleston Middle School for evacuation zones.
Things - EMS

## Some Things to Consider

Obstacles - Man-made/natural aspects
Avenues - Define the avenues for approach for potential evacuation routes
Key Areas - Area that gives you an advantage over threat 
Observation - What can I see from key area?
Cover and Concealment - Areas of protection and protection from threat's observation

If you are in a city fight/shootout, you might consider a lower caliber firearm to preserve velocity and reduce recoil. Star Wars is a really bad example

Another example would be if you needed to land aircraft on EIU's campus, where would you be able to land it? Are there electrical wires preventing it landing?
