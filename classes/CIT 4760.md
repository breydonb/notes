# Introduction
Software started in-house

## I have a problem
Outsource - turning over responsibilities for some or all of an organization's information systems applications
- Amazon AWS
- Microsoft Office

## Outsourcing vs Building Proprietary Software

Outsourcing software development <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">offers cost savings, global talent access, and scalability but comes with communication challenges and potential quality control issues.</mark> In-house development provides direct control, easier communication, and cultural alignment but may incur higher costs and face limitations in talent pool and scalability. The choice depends on factors like budget, project complexity, and desired control. A hybrid approach, combining in-house and outsourcing elements, is often favored for a balanced solution that leverages the benefits of both models.
## Non-core activities that are outsourced

Non-core information systems refer to the IT systems that support various functions within a company but are not directly related to its core business activities. These systems play a crucial role in facilitating day-to-day operations and improving overall efficiency. Here are examples of non-core information systems that companies commonly use:

- Human Resources Information System - Manages employee data, payroll, benefits administration, time and attendance tracking, and other HR-related functions.
- Customer Relationship Management Systems - Helps manage interactions with customers, tracking sales, customer service, and marketing activities to enhance relationships and improve customer satisfaction.
- **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) System:** Monitors and analyzes security events in real-time to identify and respond to potential security threats.
- **Communication and Collaboration Tools:** Includes email systems, messaging platforms, and collaboration tools like project management software to facilitate communication and teamwork.
## Cloud Computing
Cloud computing - Technology model that allows access to and delivery of computing resources over the internet. Instead of owning and maintaining physical servers and infrastructure, individuals and organizations can leverage services provided by cloud service providers to store, process, and manage data, run applications, and access various computing resources.

You can use pay per-use or license the software
### Examples
- Google Drive
	- Share, create, docs, spreadsheets, etc.
- Allows software as a service (SaaS)
## Open-Source Software
- Linux - Some distributions are open source
- MySQL - Some distributions are also open source
- Firefox - Think of Firefox's css library

### Reuse - the use of previously written software (think of adding a field to database)
- ## Object-oriented development
	- Object class encapsulates data and behavior of common organizational entities
 Example of Object-Oriented Development: 
```
#include Student.obj
<do code shit>
```
- ## Component-based development
	- Components can be like objects or large as pieces of software
	- More like methods and functions compared to classes
### Example of Component-Based Development:
```
function addTwoNumbers(int x, int y){
	return x + y;
}
```

# Scenario 1 - Burl Ives Medical Center
## Hospital uses paper records. What are the problems?
- Paper gets old and destroyed
- People can steal a paper
- Takes up physical space
- Can't easily search data
- Fire hazard
- Hard to share 
Cost benefits:
- Software Development
- IT personnel 
- Staffing
- Cybersecurity
## Outsource vs In-house
Epic also makes this software so outsourcing would be the best. The major problems with implementing this system would be relying on technologically inept people, delays, and potential security risks

## Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA)

Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) is a systematic approach to evaluating the economic feasibility of a project or decision by comparing the costs and benefits associated with it. It is a widely used technique in business, economics, and public policy to assess the desirability of an investment or action. The goal of a cost-benefit analysis is to determine whether the benefits of a decision or project outweigh its costs.

# Project Management

Project management is the systematic planning, organizing, and controlling of resources to achieve specific goals within a defined timeframe. It involves <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">initiating, planning, executing, monitoring, and closing tasks to meet project objectives efficiently.</mark> Effective project management ensures the successful completion of projects within scope, time, and budget constraints.
## Common activities
- Resolving conflict
- Team Management
- Leadership
	- Communication skills and monitoring progress
- Technical Problem Solving
- Risk Management

## Project Process

### Project Initiation
1. Establish Project Manager and teams
## Project Workbook

Project Managers love documentation. ~~Because of this I don't want to do this shit, stay in school and don't do drugs or whatever the kids say.~~ 


Project Workbooks - Repository of documentation because project managers are masochists

Project Charter - document prepared for the customer during project invitation that describes what the project will deliver and outline general goals. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Not common at all</mark>

### What is a project charter good for?

Covers You Ass (CYA) since you rely on signatures from the key stakeholders and establishes a deadline for the project (creates urgency)

## Economic Feasibility Analysis

Spreadsheet to determine [[#Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA)]] and the scalability of a project
### Communication Methods

### Closing Project


## Estimating Task Duration

Using the PERT technique, you rely on optimistic (o), pessimistic (p), and realistic (r) time estimates to determine expected time. Use this formula:

$$ET = \frac{(o + 4r + p)}{6}$$
The Critical Path relies on the longest path of completing a project and any delay in tasks on this path directly impacts the project's overall timeline. Efficiently managing critical path activities is crucial for meeting project deadlines.
### Example of Critical Path
![[Critical-path-method-CPM.jpg]]The critical path for this situation would be from <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">A -> D -> E -> F -> Finish</mark> because this is the longest path shown.
