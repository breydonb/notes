# Facility Security
Demonstrate understanding of personnel security awareness. 
## Theoretical Foundations
Based on several assumptions of human behavior
- Commit crimes when conditions exist
- Individuals choose pleasures over pain
- Human activities and natural phenomena create situations
- Opportunity of crime can be reduced by manipulating environment
It doesn't take much to change human behavior. 
### Examples
Server room with physical locks to prevent robber from getting in and stealing information.

Lighting house to give people impression you're home.

Using a fence to deter criminals from going into property.

A city built in a valley to deter invaders from invading.

## Basic Prevention Methodology

For there to be a crime/problem, you must have an offender, victim, and opportunity. 

### Examples
- Violence in the workplace
	- Victim - Educating vicim on where to go if this happens
	- Offender - Accompany security
	- Opportunity - Use security to prevent the opportunity
- Pulling fire alarms within the high school
	- Victims - can be educated on how to evacuate quickly
- Residential Burglary - breaking into houses
- Bullying in the middle school
	- Victim - Provide resources that victim can use 
	- Offender - Discipline by showing videos on effects on victim
	- Opportunity - More observation of potential offenders
- Breaking into school lockers
- University student parking lots
- Fraternity House Vandalism
	- Victim - Provide resources for home owner's insurance and funding for fraternity
	- Offender - Fining, educating on laws, and putting student on academic probation (if needed)
	- Opportunity - Increase amount of police cars driving around to prevent offenders from vandalizing 








## Security Management
Multifaceted and interdisciplinary involves criminal law policy, policy formulation, investigations, business management, and psychology. Some of the practical uses are highlighted in [[MIS-4850#Psychology, Technology, Policies Countermeasures]]

### Barriers
You can use barriers to prevent people getting in from prisons to embassies. This prevents the opportunity for offenders to commit crimes.
### Security Cameras and Motion Detectors
Whether or not security cameras or motion detectors are actually real, they are used as deterrent for offenders. 

## Operation Security (OPSEC)
Denying potential adversaries information about capabilities and/or intentions. You want to Identify, Control, and Protect

### Security Management
Security Management is better when using combination of items. You can use a Security Organization to help implement features. 

### Examples of Security Organizations
- Mercenaries
- 
### Advantages vs Disadvantages
- Cost

## Lessons of 9 / 11 and Other World Events
Security is shaped by world events and serves as consequences. Some other events include the World Trade Center Bombing, Khobar Tower Bombing, Reactor Meltdown in Japan, Oklahoma City Bombing, etc.


## Security Master Planning Goals
Preventing loss of life and minimizing injury are some of the goals of Master Planning.

Requires coordination of stakeholders and various departments. Guidance from facility management teams are important for making plans for security. Treat every site as unique, outline strategies. Enable people to use [[MIS-4850#Security Planning]]

Talk to the organization to get necessary assets worth protecting

Security master plan requires coordination of stakeholders Some examples are:
- Architects
- Engineers
- Specialty consultants
- Members of the building owner and facility management team
- Investors
## Security Master Planning Mission
No one-solution template to apply towards every facility. It has to be specific.

- Combines 3 elements: design, technology, and operations
- Outlines strategies to address perceived and potential threats (Prevention)

## Vulnerability and Risk Assessment
To build on information development through threat assessment, certain vulnerabilities may be considered minimally significant while others may be too costly. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">It doesn't define vulnerability and risk assessment. </mark> 

### Threat Determination

Client/Owner Requirements, core competencies in an organization rely on setting themselves different from competition. Hewlett-Packard (HP) relies heavily on marketing.

Some types of requirements for threat determination include:
- What is important to them?
- How much are they willing to spend?
- Are aesthetics important?
- What critical assets should be secured?
What are some determinable threats:
1. [[Environmental Analysis]]
2. [[Potential Threats]]
3. [[Threat Analysis]]
4. Environmental and Threat Analysis combines the two effectively determine threats
### Risk Analysis
It is important to determine a vulnerability assessment otherwise that can be a vulnerability. Determine the threat, then determine what assets used to address or mitigate threat. 

Risk Assessment relies on how much risk you are willing to accept if you do not address vulnerability in system. You cannot do a risk assessment without a vulnerability assessment. You should drill policies and procedures to suffice the risk assessment.

## Risk Assessment
