Obsidian is a note-taking and knowledge management application that prioritizes a "linked note" approach, encouraging users to create connections between ideas. It features a graph-based organization system, allowing for a holistic view of information relationships. Obsidian supports Markdown, offers bi-directional linking, and emphasizes customization. It promotes a dynamic and interconnected knowledge base, fostering creativity and insights. For basic testing, I am using this to hopefully help with note taking while going to Eastern Illinois University
