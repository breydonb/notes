## Definition and Features of URP

The Universal Render Pipeline (URP) is a rendering pipeline in Unity designed to provide optimized rendering for a wide range of platforms, including mobile devices, consoles, and desktop computers. It offers enhanced performance compared to Unity's built-in rendering pipeline (now known as the Built-in Render Pipeline) and is tailored to support modern rendering techniques such as physically-based rendering (PBR), dynamic lighting, and post-processing effects.

Key features of the Universal Render Pipeline include:

1. Lightweight and optimized rendering: URP is designed to be efficient, allowing developers to achieve high performance across various platforms without sacrificing visual quality.
2. Customizable rendering: It provides a high degree of flexibility and customization options, allowing developers to fine-tune rendering settings to suit their specific project requirements.
3. Shader Graph integration: URP seamlessly integrates with Unity's Shader Graph tool, enabling developers to create complex shaders visually without writing code.
4. Extensibility: URP is built with extensibility in mind, allowing developers to extend its functionality by creating custom render passes, shaders, and post-processing effects.
5. Compatibility: URP is designed to be compatible with a wide range of Unity features and assets, making it easy for developers to transition their projects from the Built-in Render Pipeline to URP.

Overall, the Universal Render Pipeline is a versatile rendering solution in Unity that offers a balance between performance and visual quality, making it suitable for a wide range of projects and platforms.
