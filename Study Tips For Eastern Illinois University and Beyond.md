# Test-Taking Skills

## Before a Test
You can use practice materials and schedule a practice sessions. Some of the resources you can use are:
- Practice Tests
- Copies of Old Exams
- Mind Map Summary Sheet
- Flash Cards
Along with this, you can rely on practice sessions to help work stuff out.

## Predicting Test Questions

You can ask the nature of the test and how the professor operates. Some of the easiest ways to predict the questions on a test by looking at the notes and class materials to determine whether or not it will be on the test. 
### Study Groups

Forming or conducting a group is essential for the overall function of test groups. You can use active recall to test members in a group while in a planned, trial-run session. Schedule time carefully, with clear starting/stopping times. End meetings with to-do lists.

## Types of Questions
### Multiple-Choice Test Questions

For multiple-choice, rely on process of elimination to choose the right solution. A lot of professors use padding in tests so answers are similar.

### True/False Question

Read the entire question and look for qualifiers and details. 

### Matching Questions

Read through each column and match similar grammar. You can also cross out items after you use them. 

### Essay Questions
What is the essay question asking? Get to the point quickly because exams are timed.

## Activity 1

### Write a prompt about the things you do not like about college
Some things that I don't like about college would be the overall balance of college and work. Sometimes it's hard for me to balance my work/school/social life without getting burnt out or overwhelmed with the things I am doing for the week. Another thing I hate is when professors lock their **damn** assignments behind lectures or centralized their release conditions towards the pertaining week of class (especially if they import the template from a previous semester). That pisses me off :(

### Now write about some things that stresses you out
Some things stressing me out right now is I feel like my work life tries to take up more time from school. Obviously, I can't quit working since I have bills to pay but I also want to get my degree. It's very annoying to try to balance my job on top of school and my boss doesn't seem to understand that. 

As for negative experiences, I don't really like the social aspect of college. I am here to get my degree and even though I should be having fun while getting it, I don't want to go to some workshop that I don't care about or some party when I can just chill at home. 

## Time Management Skills

One thing you can do would be use your calendar app along with dry-erase board. 

## Study Tips
During test weeks, it can be hard for students to effectively cope with the stress involved. Here are some things that I can do to mitigate the majority of stress put on myself.

- Do shit early (the earlier, the better)!
- Set 45 Minute - 15 Minute on/off
There are multiple questions that you can have on midterms, tests, or finals. Some include:
- Multiple Choice - pick from 4 choices and watch for all the above answers
- True / False Tests - Avoid looking for patterns and if there is any exception the answer is false.
- Essay Questions - Anticipate possible questions, reread question, make an outline, and proofread work
## Adopting a New Mindset

Internal locus is a person's belief that the power over their life and destiny is something they control while external locus is determined by people in authority.

Accept consequences for your choices. Adopt a creator mindset
- see multiple options and choose wisely
- Internal vs External Locus of Control
Mastering creator language consists of your inner critic (yourself), inner defender(others), and inner guide (solutions).

## Wise Choice Process
1. What is my present situation?
2. How would I like it to be?
	1. What is your desired outcome. 
3. What are my possible choices?
4. What's the likely outcome?
5. Which choices will I commit?
6. When and how will I evaluate my plan?

## Interdependence
Successful vs unsuccessful students usually vary on the codependency relationship. 

Active Listening - Listening to understand and putting yourself in their shoes. 
- Giving the speaker your undivided attention.
How do you respond to conflict? - Usually avoid it but when conflicted, I tend to try and level most of the time but I sometimes placate and cater towards others. 
How can you adjust communication style? - Sometimes, I need to stop helping others. Learning to say no and setting boundaries.
